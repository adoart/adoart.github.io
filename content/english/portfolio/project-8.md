Manus DevTools is a software tool developed by MANUS Meta to assist in configuring and animating models using the Manus Core SDK. It is designed to facilitate the creation of chains of nodes, which are then used to retarget real-time data from the Manus Core SDK to the model.

#### Purpose of Manus DevTools:

- Model Configuration: Manus DevTools provides a user-friendly interface for configuring models in the new Skeleton-based animation system. This includes tasks such as defining the skeleton structure, assigning nodes to bones, and setting up constraints.

- Chain Creation: Manus DevTools enables the creation and manipulation of chains of nodes. These chains represent the relationships between different parts of the model and are essential for accurately retargeting motion data.

- Real-time Retargeting: Manus DevTools serves as the bridge between the Manus Core SDK and the animated model. It receives real-time motion data from the SDK and applies it to the model using the configured chains. This allows for seamless integration of Manus motion capture data into animations.

#### Key Features of Manus DevTools:

- Visual Bones and Nodes: Manus DevTools provides a 3D visualization of the skeleton and its nodes, allowing users to clearly see the structure and relationships between the different parts of the model.

- Chain Editing and Manipulation: Manus DevTools offers tools for creating, editing, and modifying chains of nodes. This includes adding and removing nodes, adjusting their order, and setting up constraints.

- Real-time Data Visualization: Manus DevTools displays real-time motion data from the Manus Core SDK, allowing users to see how the model is responding to the captured movements.

- Animation Previewing: Manus DevTools provides a playback feature that allows users to preview animations before applying them to the model. This ensures that the motion is accurate and matches the desired movements.

#### Project Details

Overall, Manus DevTools is an essential tool for developers and animators who are working with Manus motion capture data. It provides a powerful and user-friendly interface for configuring models, creating chains, and retargeting real-time motion to achieve realistic and natural animations.
