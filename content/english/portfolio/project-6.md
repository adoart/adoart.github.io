This project was the final project of the discipline "Computer Graphics II" while I was studying in ISEC.
The task was to make a billard table with a simple animation. We decided to go further and implemented a physics engine.  

#### Project Details

Billard GL was made using OpenGL and it shows up technics like physics, lights, textures, reflections, modeling and camera manipulation.
