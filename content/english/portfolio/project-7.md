This project was the final project of the discipline "Intelligent Systems" while I was studying in ISEC.  
The task was to implement an application that uses an AI algorithm.  
At that time I was really enjoying working with OpenGL, so for this project we decided to implement the "frontend" using OpenGL and made a checkers game, single player against CPU.


#### Project Details

Checkers GL was made in OpenGL and shows up technics like artificial intelligence, lights, textures and mouse handling.
