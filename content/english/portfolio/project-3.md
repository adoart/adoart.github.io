This project was made during the course of Unity Junior Programmer Pathway.  
One of the exercises of the course was to use a provided prototype that was counting some balls falling inside a box and showing the results.
We could then make anything as long it would implement the same features, counting balls and showing the results.  
Since I have been exploring the VR area I thought "Lets make a VR basketball game!" and so it was, a couple of assets from Sketchfab and we have a HoopsVR.
