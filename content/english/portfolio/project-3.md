#### From Basic Prototype to VR Hoops

This VR basketball game, HoopsVR, wasn't built from scratch! Instead, it began as an exercise within the Unity Junior Programmer Pathway course. The course provided a starting point - a prototype that counted balls falling into a box - and challenged students to use this foundation to create something unique.

#### Spark of Inspiration

Drawing upon my recent interest in VR, I seized the opportunity to transform the ball-counting prototype into a dynamic virtual reality experience. "Let's make a VR basketball game!" I thought, and with that, the concept of HoopsVR was born.

#### Building the Experience

To bring this vision to life, assets from Sketchfab were used. Integrating these assets with the modified counting mechanic formed the core gameplay of HoopsVR. Players had to shoot virtual basketballs into a hoop, with each successful shot triggering the counting mechanism and providing visual feedback (like a scoreboard) within the VR environment.
