This project started with an interaction with one of the game developers that I follow on twitter. He posted a video of him playing a Theremin and after a small exchange I told him that I thinking doing one in VR. He then told me if I could pull off a good one in unity he would include it in his game and include me in the credits... Challenge accepted!!!
