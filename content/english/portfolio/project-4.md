#### From Inspiration to Collaboration

The story of VR theremin began with a serendipitous interaction on Twitter. After seeing a game developer playing a physical theremin, I expressed my interest in creating a VR version. He then challenged me to go ahead and if it was good it would include it in his game and credit me, this triggered the turning a mere "thinking of" into a tangible project.

#### Technical Symphony

Again I used Unity as my development platform due to its versatility and VR development capabilities. Hand tracking technology became an essential ingredient, allowing for precise and intuitive control over the virtual "theremin arms." I then incorporated sound manipulation techniques to transform hand movements into the characteristic theremin sound, involving pitch and volume adjustments based on hands position and movement.
