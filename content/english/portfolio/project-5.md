This project came from the need to have some WebGL integrated in my portfolio website.  
While starting to build my portfolio I wanted to add some WebGL somehow. Was not sure what to add and how, but once the look and feel of the page became more clear and being a big fan of "The Incal" comic books, decide to pay "tribute" and include an "Incal".  
An "Incal" is a cosmic being formed by two superimposed pyramids, one black, the other white and is the center piece of the story described in the comic books series "The Incal" by Jodorowsky and Moebius. 


"I dreamed I was flying in intergalactic space. A cosmic being formed by two superimposed pyramids, one black, the other white, was calling me. I moved toward it and found myself submerged in the center. We exploded. And that’s how my subconscious mind introduced me to “El Incal”."  
— Jodorowsky on the Incal.
