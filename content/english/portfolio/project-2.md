This project came from an idea that I've been exploring for a while, "What is like to have super powers in VR?".  
It started when google release the Day Dream framework and I tried this idea of "Jumping like Hulk" using unity, my android phone and a Google cardboard.  
This project is the evolution of this idea, this time I decided to target the Oculus Quest 2 and do some sort of infinite runner(jumper?). 
All buildings are instantiated at runtime and whenever the player goes there are always buildings to land at.

#### Project Details

"Untitled" was made using Unity and is the first VR project where I am experimenting with some game mechanics related with locomotion, one of the most challenging areas in VR.
It includes technics like procedural generation, physics and VR.
