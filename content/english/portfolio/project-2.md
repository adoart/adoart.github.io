#### Exploring Superpowers in VR

The project was born from a long-standing curiosity: What would it feel like to possess superpowers in the immersive world of Virtual Reality (VR)? This question sparked the initial prototype using Google Cardboard and Daydream, focusing on the specific power of "Jumping like Hulk."

#### From Prototype to Evolution

Encouraged by the initial idea, the project evolved further. Instead of Google Cardboard, the Oculus Quest 2 became the platform of choice, offering more advanced VR capabilities. Additionally, the gameplay transformed from a single jumping experience to an "infinite runner/jumper" format, providing continuous gameplay elements like level generation.
