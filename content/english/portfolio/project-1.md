A game about going shopping in the middle of a pandemic.  
It was made during the course of Unity Junior Programmer Pathway.  
I took the opportunity to implement an idea I got when I had to go for a last minute shopping for milk for the baby. I only had to quickly buy some milk and get back home.  
Due to the pandemic I always try to keep a safe distance and when I got to the supermarket it was a bit busy. Looked into one corridor and saw 4 people (2 on each side) completely blocking the passage and not keeping distance at all. Searched another corridor to be able to reach the milk at the end of the super market and thought to myself "This could be a game!!!".

#### Project Details

Shopping COVID was made using Unity and was the first project that I decided to make it complete from beginning to the end.  
It includes features like path finding and procedural generation.
